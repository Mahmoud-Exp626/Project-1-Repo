•	Write-up summarizes major findings and implications at a professional level 

- The Life Ladder, or happiness score was the metric in our data used to measure the happiness of the surveyed participants. It asked people to rate their life on a scale of 0 to 10 with 0 being the worst possible life and 10 being the best possible life. We observed that a higher GDP per capita is strongly correlated with higher happiness scores. This is usually associated with countries that have higher economic output per person because they report a higher sense of well-being. Healthy life expectancy is also positively correlated with happiness because healthier populations with longer life expectancies report higher levels of happiness. Another big contributor to world happiness is Social support has a significant positive correlation with happiness. Individuals with someone to count on in difficult times or have a sense of community are generally happier.
- The impact of COVID on world happiness. The pandemic led to a notable decline in mental health, contributing to an overall lower happiness score in most countries. COVID-19 caused economic hardships, particularly in lower-income countries like Peru which showed a significant drop in 2020. Further research showed that they were having a political crisis with the removal of Martin Vizcarra (President of Peru) for  mishandling of  the COVID-19 Pandemic. As for the US, there was a positive spike in 2020 which could come for a list of different factors including the injection of stimulus checks, Social Restrictions and Lockdowns diminishing social support networks, leading to lower happiness scores. Countries with robust healthcare systems and strong social safety nets demonstrated resilience and saw less impact on happiness scores.

- Corruption is also correlated with happiness, but the relationship is not as strong as with other factors. While there is a positive correlation with the Life Ladder scores, the r2 value is only 0.242, indicating that corruption explains a relatively small portion of the variation in happiness. In comparison, GDP, Social Support, and Life Expectancy have more significant correlations with happiness. However, Generosity shows no correlation with happiness with an r2 value of 0.000.  So the frequency of making charitable contributions doesn’t seem to affect one’s overall happiness.
